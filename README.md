  AllQueue Task Queue
</h1>
<p align="center">AllQueue is a open source modern job queue platform which incorporates many of the best features from other popular queues into a single full featured system.</p>


## ‚ùì Why AllQueue

There seems to be no queue platform that provides *all* the required functionality for modern apps in one spot. Many lack simple features like prioritization, or automatic DLQs, or throttling. AllQueue is an attempt to bring all these features into a single platform


Here is a list of features that AllQueue has:
- Simple deployment/configuration
- Delayed Jobs
- Independent named queues
- Prioritization within a queue (no need for different queues for 'priorty' jobs)
- Best attempt fair queuing
- Dead Letter queue
- Synchronous workflows (Jobs that depend on other jobs completing)
- Throttling queues
- In memory/disk based persistance
- Federated sharding for scalability
- Does not require ongoing maintenance of internal storage or sub-applications
- High Speed



## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quick start

Docker has 2 components. An AllqClient and the AllqServer. Your app talks to the client, and the client talks to the server (fully encrypted), no TLS to setup or maintain.
